What used to take teams in high-growth companies entire quarters to accomplish now takes individual engineers a few days.</span>
            <span class="back-phraze3">This shift has happened in every area but customer service. There, the choice remains between maintaining a patchwork of hacks, fighting the rigid structures of established platforms, or wiring together cloud call centre solutions and building homegrown ticketing systems.</span>
